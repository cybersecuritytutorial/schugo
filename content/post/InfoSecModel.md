There is a new menu option dedicated to modeling called  [Models](/models/).

The current model is in the Archi format and is easily downloadable. It covers all the capabilities we have discussed up to this point.  As we move forward we will add more to this model and build out other artifacts that support our architecture vision. We may even get adventurous and include a PowerPoint or two.

## Up Next

More architecture of course!
