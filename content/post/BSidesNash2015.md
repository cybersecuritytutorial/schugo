I got the opportunity to be at B-Sides in Nashville over the weekend. It was a great opportunity to mingle and meet people who had an interest in information security. One of the best parts was a great mix of old professionals and quite a few new people who were interesting in seeing what security is all about. It was a good time and I appreciate all the effort it took to make it happen.

[Iron Geek](http://www.irongeek.com) made his services available so we have great recordings of all the talks.

Making sure that security is woven throughout agile development can be a tricky task. This talk will walk through a solution to raising the overall level of security assurance in an agile development environment. The key goals for an environment are pretty straightforward.

* Enable the developers with knowledge and processes
* Scale security with enabled people
* Assure a better level of security with enablement and scale

Here is a link to the lively video.

An example of the method  and the general approach is at [Open Security Development Lifecycle](http://www.opensdl.com). Please take a look at this site and send in your comments and suggestions on how to make it easier for the general community to have a secure agile development environment.
