## Security BSides

You probably already know about Security BSides and how they came about. If not jump on over to [BSides](http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/12194156/FrontPage) to get the scoop.

There are many BSides events around the Chattanooga area. We have them in Knoxville, Nashville, Asheville, Atlanta, and Huntsville just to name the ones that come to mind. Chattanooga is a growing tech community and has many large and small businesses that have security concerns.

With so much going on in the area Kevin Riggs and myself have decided that a Security BSides would be a great thing to bring to town.
