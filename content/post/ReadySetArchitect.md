## A Quick Talk

This is a quick tour through why we need to architect, a couple of the frameworks, and finally several helpful tools.

It started out as a 5-minute lightning talk but turn more into an 8-minute flashflood. I want to thank the [@chadevs](https://twitter.com/chadevs) for giving me the time to come and speak to the great group there. There was a good crowd that filled up the room. If you haven't attended a Chattanooga Developers, ChaDevs, Lunch Meeting then check them out on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/chadevs/).

## The Presentation

I am posting the presentation because the last 2 pages contain the reference information on the tools and techniques.
