      <description>&lt;p&gt;For years I have worked with WordPress along with its themes, plugins, and vulnerabilities. I even purchased a couple of themes. Yes, WP can make a pretty site but at the end of the day I spent a lot of time working on WP and not working on content. It was time to move on to a different way of publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a several reasons that I moved from a dynamic site to a static site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple text-based content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content that is easily managed/backed-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Site that is free from distractions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal hosting requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal upkeep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking at least a half-a-dozen generators I went with &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34; title=&#34;Hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. Hugo is a single executable written in Golang that has a rather flexible approach. It seems to be well supported and isn&amp;rsquo;t weighed down with all the problems mentioned above. You can either compile from source or copy a single executable to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golang looks interesting but luckily you don&amp;rsquo;t actually have to get into any Go at all unless you are designing a theme or working on the templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch and see what happens. Hopefull there will be more content and less tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
