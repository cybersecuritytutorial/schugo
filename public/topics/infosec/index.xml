&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-things-first&#34;&gt;First things first&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important point, for me anyway, is that I passed the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was helpful for me to hear how other people passed their tests and how they obtained their certifications. I can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee that you will pass the test if you read this but hopefully you will pick up a couple of tips that may help you along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.secretchipmunk.com/images/CCSP.png&#34; alt=&#34;CCSP&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-ccsp&#34;&gt;What is the CCSP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The (ISC)2 CCSP is a joint effort between the (ISC)2 and the Cloud Security Alliance. They have combined informational forces to offer a certification for cloud security professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCSP covers six domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architectural Concepts &amp;amp; Design Requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Data Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Platform &amp;amp; Infrastructure Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Application Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal &amp;amp; Compliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These domains may seem similar to those covered under the CISSP and in a way they are. The major difference is that they all concentrate on those aspects that are important for securing a cloud environment. You can download the (ISC)2 pamphlet on the certification &lt;a href=&#34;http://cert.isc2.org/ccsp-exam-outline-b/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the CCSP is a relatively new certification there isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of information available for the test. As of this writing there are less than 1,000 professionals who have been certified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question you always hear is &amp;lsquo;Why is the cloud any different and isn&amp;rsquo;t it just someone else&amp;rsquo;s computer?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is huge amount of overlap between regular third parties, managed services providers, and cloud service providers. This is what most people are referring to when they say that it is all the same. Even though there are a lot of similarities the differences are significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of differences just to name a few:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-tenancy is the norm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual segmentation and micro-segmentation is a must&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development utilizes different tools and processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer behavior has been changed with this environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Businesses are &amp;lsquo;all in&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your security controls have to be able to handle widely distributed situations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The huge rush to the cloud along with the change in behavior are driving reasons we need more security professionals to be familiar with this environment. If we think back we had other such migrations or explosions. We moved from the mainframe to small computers. We moved from monolithic applications to distributed systems. The Internet grew up and now we are moving to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall behavior of people and businesses are changing. We have to take that into account as security professionals in order to provide the best security advice and the most fitting security controls. It isn&amp;rsquo;t just a change in technology that we have to adjust to moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;passing-the-test&#34;&gt;Passing the test&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My development background, architecture background, and work over the years as a CISSP did help with the certification. Experience is almost always a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The materials came from many different sources. Here were the main ones I used for the test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Official CCSP CBK Participant Guide (PDF from online class, see below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Official-ISC-Guide-CCSP-CBK/dp/1119276721&#34;&gt;The Official (ISC)2 CCSP CBK 2nd edition, Sybex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.isc2.org/ccsp-training/default.aspx&#34;&gt;(ISC)2 CCSP online class&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/assets/research/security-guidance/csaguide.v3.0.pdf&#34;&gt;Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing v3.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://research.cloudsecurityalliance.org/tci/&#34;&gt;CSA Enterprise Architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISO 17788, 17789 Cloud Computing Definitions and Reference Architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-security-guide-for-smes&#34;&gt;ENISA Cloud Security Guide for SMEs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf&#34;&gt;NIST SP 800-30 Risk Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various materials on BCDR including those from the CISSP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indirectly NIST 800-53r4, ISO 27001:2103, ISO 27002:2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://collaboration.opengroup.org/jericho/cloud_cube_model_v1.0.pdf&#34;&gt;The Cloud Cube Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;studying&#34;&gt;Studying&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CBK should be the main source of any test so I spent a considerable amount of time reading the Sybex CBK book plus I took the online class. The class consisted of 28 hours of video, an older CBK PDF, some flashcards, and study questions. The most positive aspect of the online class was that it was worth 40 CPEs for a CISSP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sybex CBK and the class also had study questions but the ones in the book were identical to those online. I didn&amp;rsquo;t use the older CBK Participant Guide. It had several group study questions but other than that it didn&amp;rsquo;t offer very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the end of my three month study time I began to really look at the Cloud Security Alliance materials. To my surprise they were much more detailed, were practically in the same order, and shared the same graphics. I felt like I should have put a lot more emphasis on the CSA materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to approach this again I would use an outline similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Sybex CBK to get an idea of the domains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightly read the CSA materials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the miscellaneous materials

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definitions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business Continuity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic cloud infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic cloud security controls (TLS, CASB, IPSec, PKI, encryption)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Certifications and Sec/Privacy regs (SOC 1/2/3, EU, PCI DSS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development life cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing methods for applications, system, networks, clouds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand accountability and responsibility when it comes to data, privacy, controls, and the law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browse the Sybex CBK again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study the CSA materials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold all of that in your head and run to take the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very broad test. It boils down to how we should do security architecture in the cloud. It you don&amp;rsquo;t have any experience with cloud deployment, cloud contracts, cloud integration, or cloud security controls this test may be very hard for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;opinion&#34;&gt;Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;official-materials&#34;&gt;Official Materials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some issues with the test as advertised and the materials provided. The online class should be more than someone reading what is available in a book. The questions in the CBK and the questions for the class should not match word-for-word. I would expect the class to offer more insight and a greater depth or breadth of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Sybex study guide is due out in April of 2017. It will be interesting to see if it is more applicable than the previous versions of the CBKs. Either way you will need to greatly supplement the official Sybex CBK in order to get a good understanding of cloud security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-approach&#34;&gt;Cloud Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cloud approach we use today is not as black-and-white as it is described in many of the books. It isn&amp;rsquo;t just IaaS, or just PaaS, or just SaaS. These lines are blurring and changing quickly. Most large cloud service providers do provide all these services and some that aren&amp;rsquo;t easily classified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test makes the mistake of being too rigid and uses context that are not clear. We need to be more concerned with the process being executed and the correct security control that needs to be applied than we do trying to make the situation fit into one of the service model boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is convenient to use the service labels but reality isn&amp;rsquo;t quite playing out that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think this certification is useful in today&amp;rsquo;s environment. You might have a lot of exposure to a specific cloud aspect but the certification ensures that you will be aware of all the aspects of cloud computing which is needed in order to properly apply risk management and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or comments leave them here or drop me a note. You can always reach me at &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/scmunk&#34;&gt;@scmunk&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;mailtto:scmunk@secretchipmunk.com&#34;&gt;scmunk@secretchipmunk.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are in a super-shared, and super-scaled world where rights are no longer concentrated in one place. Your rights and permissions are living everywhere in the neighborhood. They have left home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These is the presentation I used for a basic talk on why it is important to understnad how entitlements work these day. It was meant for presenting but you may get somehting out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been given the opportunity to speak at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bsidesnash.org/&#34;&gt;B-Sides Nashville 2016&lt;/a&gt;. This year&amp;rsquo;s topic will be all about identity access and management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IAM Complicated: Why you need to know about Identity and Access Management&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know where identities are born? How can you tell what an identify can and can&amp;rsquo;t do? What do you do when you realize your refrigerator has an identity of its own? If your IPS blocks your refrigerator you may lose access to your pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identity and Access Management is what connects the identities, accounts, entitlements, roles, permissions, and resources to provide correct access control. All areas of security are dependent on IAM and need to understand how to take advantage of it. This talk will explore the IAM lifecycle showing how to protect it and wreck it along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-full-lifecycle&#34;&gt;The Full Lifecycle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people don&amp;rsquo;t look past the use of ids and passwords. It helps to understand the full breadth of this space especially now that IAM borders have expanded to include more third-parties (CSPs), ubiquitous mobile, and most importantly a much more dynamic environment. Look at how Docker has changed the security provisioning landscape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a growing need to incorporate identity and access management into Threat and Vulnerability/Network Security. The information gathered and the intelligence built needs to incorporate all the pieces in order to have a holistic view of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By looking at the full IAM lifecycle, including entitlement management, you can see where you can take advantage of the situation no matter which team you are supporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;b-sides-2016&#34;&gt;B-Sides 2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So be sure to make plans and get your tickets for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bsidesnash.org/&#34;&gt;B-Sides Nashville 2016&lt;/a&gt;. There are a lot of great speakers and you can&amp;rsquo;t beat the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the condensed version of how to mix security into agile development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.secretchipmunk.com/docs/AgileAndSecurityOilAndWaterHO.pdf&#34;&gt;Agile and Security. (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;concept-platform&#34;&gt;Concept Platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic framework for the concept has been built around a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pmwiki.com&#34;&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opensamm.org&#34;&gt;OpenSAMM&lt;/a&gt;. This framework should be good enough to grow the idea and determine if it will add security value. The current version is here:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got the opportunity to be at B-Sides in Nashville over the weekend. It was a great opportunity to mingle and meet people who had an interest in information security. One of the best parts was a great mix of old professionals and quite a few new people who were interesting in seeing what security is all about. It was a good time and I appreciate all the effort it took to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irongeek.com&#34;&gt;Iron Geek&lt;/a&gt; made his services available so we have great recordings of all the talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidesnashville2015/mainlist&#34;&gt;B-Sides Nashvile Videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making sure that security is woven throughout agile development can be a tricky task. This talk will walk through a solution to raising the overall level of security assurance in an agile development environment. The key goals for an environment are pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable the developers with knowledge and processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale security with enabled people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assure a better level of security with enablement and scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to the lively video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidesnashville2015/b04-agile-and-security-oil-and-water-ron-parker&#34;&gt;Agile and Security. Oil and Water?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of the method  and the general approach is at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opensdl.com&#34;&gt;Open Security Development Lifecycle&lt;/a&gt;. Please take a look at this site and send in your comments and suggestions on how to make it easier for the general community to have a secure agile development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We need a no-frills and roughly-right life-cycle to raise our level of software Security Assurance. Right now there are several security life-cycles both in the wild and  available through vendors. None of those attend to the full spectrum of security and risk needs. Most are heavily centered around software testing but the security umbrella is much larger than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe more importantly development and delivery methodologies have changed drastically over the last couple of years. This is even becoming true of the large scale enterprise shops. The pace of everything is increasing and the limited number of security practitioners can no longer scale to fit the need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a security development life-cycle that truly effects security assurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;opensdl-objectives&#34;&gt;OpenSDL Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make security an enabler for development teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale security to where it needs to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fit any development methodology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover the major aspects of security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase the overall level of security assurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;opensdl-deliverables&#34;&gt;OpenSDL Deliverables&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The essential security checklist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An SDL knowledgebase driven by the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A platform that enables continuous improvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;concept-platform&#34;&gt;Concept Platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic framework for the concept has been built around a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pmwiki.com&#34;&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opensamm.org&#34;&gt;OpenSAMM&lt;/a&gt;. This framework should be good enough to grow the idea and determine if it will add security value. The current version is here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t read the glossary because no one reads that but how often do you jump straight to the end of a document to read an appendix?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be truthful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t but sometimes you really should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-the-tower&#34;&gt;Building the Tower&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information Security controls have been a hot topic lately. Actually the discussion has been more around the lack of controls or how poorly the controls were implemented. In the InfoSec industry there are lots of definitions for these controls. Many major governing, financial and auditing bodies have their own set of them or their own framework to explain them. In doing so they just about build their own security language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proliferation is also how we got to the infamous number of cross-references for controls we have in the security world. You have three pages of controls and then ten pages of cross-references where they explain why their controls are almost just the same but somehow they add extra value. The many sets of controls have become &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/1enYeyv&#34;&gt;The Tower of Babel&lt;/a&gt; for security professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-need-for-esperanto&#34;&gt;The Need for Esperanto&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we don&amp;rsquo;t need &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/1fGwwAY&#34;&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt; but we do need to look for more ways to use what we have and build upon it to make it better. We could be putting more energy into refactoring and improving than building new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how much you like or dislike them the most stable set of control definitions is from NIST. To be more specific it is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://1.usa.gov/1hg5DEy&#34;&gt;NIST Special Publication 800-53 Rev 4&lt;/a&gt;. These controls are the most widely referenced controls for security today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting points about the 800-53 document is that all the good stuff is at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.secretchipmunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/80053Appd.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.secretchipmunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/80053Appd.png&#34; alt=&#34;800-53 r4 Appendicies&#34; width=&#34;590&#34; height=&#34;213&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-221&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-1 is a full list or catalog of all the main security controls. These controls covered the main security goals of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA). This was good for government agencies but it was missing an aspect for the commercial sector. The commercial sector is also worried about regulations and privacy issues. These are alluded to in the basic CIA triad but the triad does not provide the full coverage needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revision 4 of the NIST 800-53 included a control catalog just for privacy issues. For many industries this is an important change. It now makes the 800-53 a lot more cross-industry capable and should eventually remove some of the need for so many different control frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the first half of what is included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.secretchipmunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/80053AppdJ.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.secretchipmunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/80053AppdJ.png&#34; alt=&#34;80053AppdJ&#34; width=&#34;596&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-222&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the addition of the privacy controls industries can now use this as a much broader reference than before. This is especially true if you are a regulated company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-end&#34;&gt;The End&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revisit the NIST offerings. It continues to be updated and be made more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to take a look at how this fits into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://1.usa.gov/18ERiNh&#34;&gt;CyberSecurity Framework update&lt;/a&gt; that was just released a couple of weeks ago. Maybe we can look at that next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;being-capable&#34;&gt;Being Capable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talk a lot in security world. Most of the time we seem to talk about all the possibilities when we need to talk more about what we can actually do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are we capable of doing? We do we need to be capable of doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;being-capable-with-capabilities&#34;&gt;Being Capable with Capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we want to talk with our partners, whether those partners are business-related, very technical or just your managers, you need some consistent way to describe what security does. So many times we use a dozen terms that are all intermingled and ill-defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to bring some consistency to your communications, to your planning and even to your budgeting process is to use a capabilities map. By defining what you do and using those definitions across the board you can eliminate one source of confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is a capability?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOGAF says that a &lt;a href=&#34;http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap03.html&#34;&gt;capability&lt;/a&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ability that an organization, person, or system possesses. Capabilities are typically expressed in general and high-level terms and typically require a combination of organization, people, processes, and technology to achieve. For example, marketing, customer contact, or outbound telemarketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time capabilities are strictly business related but they can also be put in a different contexts. We can use them to describe what a security organization does or even what a functional area does within a larger organization. At its most basic level a capability is what you do but not how you do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-example&#34;&gt;An Example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A security organization may put together a capabilities map in order to determine where it needs to invest in order to meet the challenges of the day or to help deliver secure business requirements. The same map can be used across all areas of the business. The leaders and stakeholders can all discuss security and risk using a consistent view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all a capabilities map really is. It is a view of the business or domain. If I bring up the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; word, Architecture, for a moment I would say that capabilities are a first step in determining a conceptual view of your area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with a list of WHAT you provide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating IDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resetting passwords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing access control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you make a first pass try to group similar capabilities. Once you have a several items try to group them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identity and Access Management

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating IDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resetting passwords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network Security

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IDS/IPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NAC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend some time determining the minimum number of groups. Concentrate on building out the first two layers of your capabilities. We will call the top layer Level 1 Capabilities and the next layer down Level 2 Capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identity and Access Management&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage Access Control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage Identity Lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide Infrastructure Security

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide Boundary Protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage Configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can make our list more presentable too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.secretchipmunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Capability.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.secretchipmunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Capability.png&#34; alt=&#34;Capability&#34; width=&#34;375&#34; height=&#34;284&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-188&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recap&#34;&gt;Recap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is a capability?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are WHAT you do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A capability may include people, processes and technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are part of a terminology and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy&#34;&gt;taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can be represented with a picture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can be represented with a list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple levels of capabilities can be used to represent varying levels of complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much more importantly what can we do once we have built a capabilities map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A map provides a common picture to be used in communicating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The common terminology and views can help guide objectives and strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can be a common thread through your maturity models, gap analysis, and roadmaps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can easily see and communicate where you are investing your resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-time&#34;&gt;Next Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Part II we will look to continue building out our example set of capabilities for a security organization. It would also be a good time to investigate why you can&amp;rsquo;t just reference all the other frameworks out there like ISO 27001, (ISC)2, or even SABSA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ecstatic Over Static Passwords</title>
      <link>http://www.secretchipmunk.com/blog/2015/03/12/ecstatic-over-static-passwords/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Well maybe not ecstatic but it is pretty exciting that I have been carrying around a way to house a strong static password and didn&amp;rsquo;t even realize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.secretchipmunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/black_single.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.secretchipmunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/black_single.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;YubiKey&#34; width=&#34;453&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-182&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yubico.com/&#34;&gt;Yubikey&lt;/a&gt; for over a year now and have used it successfully with &lt;a href=&#34;https://lastpass.com&#34;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;. A YubiKey is a handy USB or Near Field Communications (NFC) device that can generate a variety of authentication responses. The default is a One Time Password (OTP) that can be verified via a server running the Yubico software. It is an inexpensive way to provide a two-factor authentication method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little did I know, mainly because I don&amp;rsquo;t always read the instructions, that most YubiCo devices have the ability to hold multiple slots or multiple generators. A slot can be configured to generate the Yubico OTP, a Challenge-response, an industry standard OATH response or it can return a static password generated by you. You press the sensor quickly to activate slot 1 or you press it for more than two seconds to activate slot 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-revelation&#34;&gt;The Revelation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totally missed the part about a static password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short static passwords are usually a bad thing but strong static passwords have their place. The best way to use this is to store a strong password suffix on the YubiKey and then you supply the prefix. What you end up with is a strong variable password that most people could not or would not take the time to memorize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the YubiKey allows you to store from 16-64 characters in the static section depending on the model the resulting password could be quite long. The key is configured using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/personalization-tools/&#34;&gt;YubiCo Personalization Tool&lt;/a&gt; by selecting the &lt;em&gt;Static Password Option&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use an 8 character prefix and a 32 character suffix that produces a 40 character password with ease. For example the prefix for your Twitter account may be &amp;lsquo;Blurb2Derp&amp;rsquo; and your static key may be &amp;lsquo;ljI10lakhjH_!@#947 *&amp;amp;ghdN1il1li1&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use your new strong password type in your prefix then press the sensor for more than two seconds. A password wonder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb2DerpljI10lakhjH_!@#947 *&amp;amp;ghdN1il1li1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It still will be up to you to generate a total password that has the proper number of security bits and level of entropy. The good point is that you can store the static portion of a password that was generated randomly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this method you could memorize a prefix for each site and use the YubiKey to enter the majority of the password. This would be great for those long &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.truecrypt.org/&#34; title=&#34;TruCrypt&#34;&gt;TruCrypt&lt;/a&gt; passwords that you never can seem to remember. This method may be an issue if you have some sites that disallow special characters or limit your password to 8 characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ecstatic-static&#34;&gt;Ecstatic Static&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several different models of YubiKeys. YubiCo also provides several other authentication methods along with integrations with several major vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to go change my passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
